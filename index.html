        <div class="subheading mb-5">AccountantðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Celine Chien is currently a freshman at the University of California - Riverside majoring in pre-business and hopes to concentrate in accounting. She took business every year during her high school career. Outside of school, she loves to dedicate her time towards volunteering. The summer before high school, she volunteered for 2 months at a local senior center. Some tasks included entertaining the elderly, walking the community, dog, replenishing refreshments, and setting the tables. Key takeaways included the importance of patience and having an open mind that was always willing to learn more. That same summer, Celine volunteered at her library, specifically at the summer reading program. There, she was in charge of listening to the summaries of books the children read; afterwards, she stamped their cards and distributed prizes to them. This past summer, she traveled overseas to teach English to children in Taiwan for a month. The first week was spent lesson planning with the head teacher and getting tips and tricks on which methods were the most engaging and easy to understand. The subsequent 3 weeks were spent teaching the children. Our lessons centered around a central theme, which was holidays; we first began by introducing the American holidays in a mixture of English and Chinese and tested how much knowledge they retained through a quizlet with English vocabulary terms that best described the holidays. Afterwards, we would have them be hands-on with our craft session: we chose crafts that they could each participate in. For example, for New Years, we had them make photo booth props; for Christmas, we had them make Christmas tree ornaments made out of popsicle sticks; for Valentineâ€™s Day, we had them cut out hearts where they would write a message to a classmate of their choosing and put the hearts in their classmatesâ€™ bags; for Halloween, we had them go outside during break and each of the 3 teachers would hide somewhere in the playground and it was up to the children to come find us as a part of their trick or treating journey; for Thanksgiving, they made hand turkeys. For the last session of class, we would play a game of I Spy with the children. How this would work is that we would give each table a page printed from the book and then have them repeat the English sentence after us and translate the main item into Chinese if they were having trouble understanding it. Each group would frantically search for the item in order to be the first group to raise their hand and earn a point for the group. As an incentive, each table group would held to a point system where they gained points from correctly answering questions. At the end of the month, whichever group had the most points would be rewarded with a mystery goody bag. From this experience, I learned a few takeaways. Of them included the importance of perseverance and patience. They occasionally wouldnâ€™t understand certain sections of the lesson, forcing the teachers to backtrack and implement a different teaching method to accommodate their learning speeds. In addition, they would sometimes rebel for no reason; causing the teachers to take time out of their day to correct their behavior.<br><br>
